# DotA2 Patch Play #

In this project I follow DotA 2 Pro Circuit matches for four years, in order to analyze the games patch update practices.
In DotA the players are foremost supplied with a set of Heroes and Items, a map and a system to connect, in order to play with teammates or random people and against other teams or random people.

Around this basic supply of game utensils there are several layers to increase activity with the platform and bind players. With about 400.000 online players around the clock [1](https://steamcharts.com/app/570#All) and with an overall  median of 1633 hours [2] a user spend playing  ( which in some cases goes up to 60.000 hours [3] ). So they are top notch in having peoples attention.
